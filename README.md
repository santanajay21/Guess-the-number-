# 🎯 Random Number Guessing Game  

A simple Python program where the user tries to guess a randomly generated number. The number of attempts is based on the selected difficulty level.  

## 🚀 How It Works  

1. The program generates a random number within a specified range.  
2. The user selects a difficulty level, which determines the number of allowed attempts.  
3. The user enters guesses until they either:  
   - Guess the correct number 🎉  
   - Run out of attempts ❌  

## 🎮 Difficulty Levels  

- **Easy** 🟢 – More attempts   
- **Hard** 🔴 – Fewer attempts
